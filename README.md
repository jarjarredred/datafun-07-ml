## CheatSheet: Managing Virtual Environment

For **Windows PowerShell** (adjust commands if using Mac/Linux):

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```powershell
   py -m venv .venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel:

   ```powershell
   py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```

4. Install required packages:

   ```powershell
   py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

## CheatSheet: Running Python Scripts

Remember to activate your `.venv` (and install packages if they haven't been installed yet) before running files. Verify that all external packages imported into a file are included in `requirements.txt` (and have NOT been commented out).

Run Python scripts using the following commands:

   ```powershell
   py demo_script.py
   py do_stats.py
   py draw_chart.py
   py greet_user.py
   ```
